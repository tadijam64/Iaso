$$
risk \ score = \sum_{precondition=1}^6 0.5 \times exists
\\score = \sum_{symptom=1}^8 symptom\times weight  + min(max(risk\ score, \ 0), 1)
$$





## Onset of symptoms

Mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days. (WHO/CCDC joint research)
Onset of severe disease, dyspnea (5 days p>0.2), hypoxia/hospital admition (7 days, p>0.009), ARDS (8 days, p>.97)

1 week severe by WHO/CCDC

## Higher risk individuals (ECDC/WHO/CCDC/TESSy)

- People aged over 60
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Cardiovascular disease
- Chronic respiratory disease
- Cancer

# WHO case definition guideline

## Suspect case 

1. A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset. 
2. A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; 
3. A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that fully explains the clinical presentation. 

## Probable case 

1. A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive. 

   a. Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory. OR 

   b. A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason

## Definition of contact

A contact is a person who experienced any one of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days  after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case: 

1. Face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within 1 meter and for more than 15 minutes; 
  2. Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case; 
3. Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal protective equipment1 ; OR 
4. Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments. Note: for confirmed asymptomatic cases, the period of contact is measured as the 2 days before through the 14 days after the date on which the sample was taken which led to confirmation.
